<p>According to Keynesian Economics, there are three main ways a government can stabilize an economy during a recession. One way is to decrease interest rates. This allows easier borrowing for businesses and therefore creates more jobs. The second way a government can increase jobs is by decreasing taxes. This is based on the same idea that additional money in the hands of citizens will allow for more businesses to stay open. The third main way a government can stabilize a recession is by increasing spending to again put more money in the hands of citizens. </p>

<p> We can notice a couple of basic correlations on the preliminary heatmap. For example, we can see that obviously the more farming an economy has, the fewer service employees the country has. Then we will start to notice other things like the higher the  minimum wage, the more energy costs. We can see that the interest, taxes, and unemployment before the recession are correlated to those variables during the recession. The correlations to unemployment are:</p>

<p>Data was difficult to collect due to the fact that all nations have varying levels of data collection and are rarely consistent with other nations. We were initially going to hone in on the European Union, but their data collection wasn't as good as we had anticipated and didn't start being widely collected until after 2008. We then transitioned to finding data for the entire world. All of our data ended up coming from the world bank except for minimum wage which came from the International Labor Organization and occupation which came from the CIA World Factbook. For x-variables, we use data that was available in 2007 for prediction purposes, but we use the change between 2010 and 2007 to identify best practices for governments after a recession has hit. The y-axis is unemployment from 2010. <br><b>agriculture:</b> Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)<br><b>services:</b> Employment in services (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)<br><b>industry:</b> Employment in industry (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)<br><b>minwage:</b> Minimum wage annually by county in USD<br><b>pretax:</b> Taxes on income, profits and capital gains in 2007<br><b>posttax:</b> Taxes on income, profits and capital gains in 2010<br><b>tax:</b> The difference in taxes between 2010 and 2007 (posttax - pretax)<br><b>preunemployment:</b> Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate) in 2007<br><b>postunemployment:</b> Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate) in 2010<br><b>prerealinterest:</b> Real interest rate (%) in 2007<br><b>postrealinterest:</b> Real interest rate (%) in 2010<br><b>prespending:</b> General government final consumption expenditure (% of GDP) in 2007<br><b>postspending:</b> General government final consumption expenditure (% of GDP) in 2010<br><b>spending:</b> Difference in spending between 2010 and 2007 (postspending - prespending)<br><b>kWhcapita:</b> Electric power consumption (kWh per capita)<br><b>incomeshare:</b> Income share held by highest 10%</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a Model to decide Changes</h3>
<p>One major issue that our team had was that there is a very limited amount of consistent data for the countries. Of the features that we had, the maximum number of data points was 162 and the minimum was 80. This created a necessity to make our model as simple as possible as including all potential features would limit our data to only 23 data points. To ensure we only kept only the most important variables, we created a function much like regsubsets where it chooses the highest R^2 score from possible subsets and we are able to force certain features to be included in R except it accounted for potential blank data points for each combination as opposed to the whole dataset (Our function only seemed efficient enough to work on up to around 200 combinations). </p>
<p> <b>Variables that don't affect future unemployment:</b> Initial Government Spending (prespending), Change in Real Interest Rates (realinterest), Real Interest Rates (prerealinterest), and Change in Taxation Rates (tax).<br> All of these had P>|t| of .4 or more.<br> Our final model for identifying changes in policy looked like this:
<p> <img src="topols.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div></p>
<p> <img src="bottomols.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div></p>
<p>Based on this model, we can choose two policies between monetary and fiscal policy. <br> <b>Decrease Spending During a Recession:</b> We see that there is no impact on unemployment based on initial spending, but we see that there is a positive correlation between the act of increasing spending and unemployment. This goes against Keynesian economics, but a possible explanation would be that increased spending makes people wary of the possibility of a country going bankrupt and therefore less advantageous for business. <br><b>Make Taxes on income, profits and capital gains 42% Before the Next Recession:</b> We can see that the 2007 tax variable is -.0757X+.0009X^2 If we solve for the minimum, we can see that we can decrease unemployment by up to 1.6% by putting the taxes to 42%. </p>

<p>We will use the same regsubsets function as we did before, but we will not force any variables to be included and we will exclude the variables that are based on changes after a recession hits. We let the function slim down the number of features until there is no feature where P>|t| > .2. The first model like this is three features displayed here:</p>
